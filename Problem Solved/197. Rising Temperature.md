# 197. Rising Temperature
## Describtion
Given a `Weather` table, write a SQL query to find all dates' Ids with higher temperature compared to its previous (yesterday's) dates.
 ```
 +---------+------------------+------------------+
| Id(INT) | RecordDate(DATE) | Temperature(INT) |
+---------+------------------+------------------+
|       1 |       2015-01-01 |               10 |
|       2 |       2015-01-02 |               25 |
|       3 |       2015-01-03 |               20 |
|       4 |       2015-01-04 |               30 |
+---------+------------------+------------------+
 ```

## Idea
First step: Join `weather` table with another `weather` table, with condition that the `id` value is not equal
Second step: Set the condition in `where`, which is date1 should be greater than date2 and the temperature in data1 should also be greater than in data2.

## Solution
 ```sql
SELECT W2.Id
FROM Weather W1 INNER JOIN Weather W2 ON W1.Id != W2.Id
WHERE W2.Temperature > W1.Temperature 
  AND W2.RecordDate>W1.RecordDate
  AND DATEDIFF(W2.RecordDate,W1.RecordDate) = 1;
 ```
