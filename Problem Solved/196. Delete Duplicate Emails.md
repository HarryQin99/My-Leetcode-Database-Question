# 196. Delete Duplicate Emails
## Describtion
Write a SQL query to delete all duplicate email entries in a table named Person, keeping only unique emails based on its smallest Id.
 ```
 +----+------------------+
| Id | Email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
| 3  | john@example.com |
+----+------------------+
Id is the primary key column for this table.
 ```

## Idea
The main part of this question is to delete all the duplicate email and keep the smallest id. Therefore, the first step is to figure out which id is the smallest id for each email. 
Secondly, delect all the data whose id is not in those 'valid' id.

## Solution
 ```sql
DELETE 
FROM Person
WHERE Id NOT IN (SELECT *
                 FROM (SELECT MIN(Id)
                       FROM Person
                       GROUP BY Email) AS Table1);
 ```
