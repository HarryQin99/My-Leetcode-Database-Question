# 183. Customers Who Never Order
## Describtion
Suppose that a website contains two tables, the *Customers* table and the *Orders* table. Write a SQL query to find all customers who never order anything.
 ```
 table Customers
 +----+-------+
| Id | Name  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | Joe   |
| 2  | Henry |
| 3  | Sam   |
| 4  | Max   |
+----+-------+
 ```
 ```
 table Orders
 +----+------------+
| Id | CustomerId |
+----+------------+
| 1  | 3          |
| 2  | 1          |
+----+------------+
 ```
 ## Idea
 Using sub-query to figure out which CustomerId has ever ordered anything first, and figure out the CustomerId which is not in those CustomerId.

 ## Solution
  ```sql
  SELECT Name AS Customers
FROM Customers
WHERE Id NOT IN (SELECT C.Id
                   FROM Customers C INNER JOIN Orders O ON C.Id = O.CustomerId);
  ```
