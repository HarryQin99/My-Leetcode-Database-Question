# 180. Consecutive Numbers
## Describtion
Write a SQL query to find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.
 ```
 +----+-----+
| Id | Num |
+----+-----+
| 1  |  1  |
| 2  |  1  |
| 3  |  1  |
| 4  |  2  |
| 5  |  1  |
| 6  |  2  |
| 7  |  2  |
+----+-----+
 ```
For example, given the above Logs table, 1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.
 ```
 +-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |
+-----------------+
 ```
## Idea
Using the function `LAG` for this question to figure out the ID value of a row at 2 offset which comes before the current row, which share the same valuf of Num. Finally, compare two id value, the difference should be 2.

**Introduction of `LAG`: SQL Server LAG() is a window function that provides access to a row at a specified physical offset which comes before the current row.** 
 ```
 LAG(return_value ,offset [,default]) 
OVER (
    [PARTITION BY partition_expression, ... ]
    ORDER BY sort_expression [ASC | DESC], ...
)
 ```
## Solution
 ```sql
 SELECT DISTINCT Num ConsecutiveNums
 FROM (SELECT Id, Num, LAG(Id, 2) OVER(PARTITION BY Num ORDER BY Id) Id_twobefore
       FROM Logs) l
       WHERE Id_twobefore+2 = Id;
 ```
