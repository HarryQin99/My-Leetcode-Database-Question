# 178. Rank Scores
## Describtion
Write a SQL query to rank scores. If there is a tie between two scores, both should have the same ranking. Note that after a tie, the next ranking number should be the next consecutive integer value. In other words, there should be no "holes" between ranks.
 ```
+----+-------+
| Id | Score |
+----+-------+
| 1  | 3.50  |
| 2  | 3.65  |
| 3  | 4.00  |
| 4  | 3.85  |
| 5  | 4.00  |
| 6  | 3.65  |
+----+-------+
 ```
 ## Idea
 Apply to the function `DENSE_RANK()`, which allocates an ranking value to each data point. 
 
 **In order to keep to same score with two same ranking value, do not use distinct here.** 
 
 *The word 'Rank' is a reversed word, in order to use it as a column name, we need to used an apostrophe before and after it*

 ## Solution
  ```sql
  SELECT Score, table1.score_rank AS 'Rank'
  FROM(SELECT Score, DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY Score DESC) AS score_rank
       FROM Scores) AS table1;
  ```
