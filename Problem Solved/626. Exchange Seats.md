# 626. Exchange Seats
## Describtion
Mary is a teacher in a middle school and she has a table seat storing students' names and their corresponding seat ids.
The column id is continuous increment.
Mary wants to change seats for the adjacent students.
Can you write a SQL query to output the result for Mary?
 ```
+---------+---------+
|    id   | student |
+---------+---------+
|    1    | Abbot   |
|    2    | Doris   |
|    3    | Emerson |
|    4    | Green   |
|    5    | Jeames  |
+---------+---------+
 ```
For the sample input, the output is:
 ```
+---------+---------+
|    id   | student |
+---------+---------+
|    1    | Doris   |
|    2    | Abbot   |
|    3    | Green   |
|    4    | Emerson |
|    5    | Jeames  |
+---------+---------+
 ```
If the number of students is odd, there is no need to change the last one's seat.

## Idea
First step: Using Left Join to whose id value is the '`Id` + 1' or '`Id` - 1'
Second step: Using `case when` to extract correct information in particular condition
Finally, Using `ORDER BY` to get the result in order.

## Solution
 ```sql
SELECT s1.id, 
        case when s1.id%2=1 then ifnull(s2.student, s1.student)
        when s1.id%2=0 then s3.student
        end as student
FROM seat s1 LEFT JOIN seat s2 ON s2.id = s1.id+1 LEFT JOIN seat s3 ON s3.id = s1.id-1
ORDER BY s1.id
 ```
