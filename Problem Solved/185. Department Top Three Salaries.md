# 185. Department Top Three Salaries
## Describtion
The Employee table holds all employees. Every employee has an Id, and there is also a column for the department Id.
 ```
 +----+-------+--------+--------------+
| Id | Name  | Salary | DepartmentId |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| 1  | Joe   | 85000  | 1            |
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 2            |
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | 2            |
| 4  | Max   | 90000  | 1            |
| 5  | Janet | 69000  | 1            |
| 6  | Randy | 85000  | 1            |
| 7  | Will  | 70000  | 1            |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
 ```
The Department table holds all departments of the company.
 ```
 +----+----------+
| Id | Name     |
+----+----------+
| 1  | IT       |
| 2  | Sales    |
+----+----------+
 ```
 Write a SQL query to find employees who earn the top three salaries in each of the department. For the above tables, your SQL query should return the following rows (order of rows does not matter).
  ```
  +------------+----------+--------+
| Department | Employee | Salary |
+------------+----------+--------+
| IT         | Max      | 90000  |
| IT         | Randy    | 85000  |
| IT         | Joe      | 85000  |
| IT         | Will     | 70000  |
| Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |
| Sales      | Sam      | 60000  |
+------------+----------+--------+
  ```

## Idea
First step: Using ``DENSE_RANK()`` to allocate each salary value a ranking value based on its ranking of that department, created a sub-query on it.

Second step: Figure out whose ranking is 1 or 2 or 3 in that sub-query, therefor we could find out who have the top 3 salary in each of the departments.

## Solution
 ```sql
SELECT Department, Employee, Salary
FROM (SELECT Employee.Id, Employee.Name AS Employee, Salary, DepartmentID, DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY DepartmentId ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS rankn, Department.Name AS Department
FROM Employee INNER JOIN Department ON Employee.DepartmentId = Department.Id) AS Table1
WHERE Table1.rankn = 1 OR Table1.rankn = 2 OR Table1.rankn = 3;
 ```
