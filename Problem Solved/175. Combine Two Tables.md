```
Write a SQL query for a report that provides the following information for each person in the Person table, regardless if there is an address for each of those people:
```FirstName, LastName, City, State```

## Idea
Due to **regardless if there is an address for each of those people**, choose to use left join of Person and Address table.

## Solution
 ```sql
SELECT P.FirstName, P.LastName, A.City, A.State
FROM Person AS P LEFT JOIN Address AS A ON P.PersonID = A.PersonID;
```
