# 596. Classes More Than 5 Students
## Describtion
There is a table `courses` with columns: student and class
Please list out all classes which have more than or equal to 5 students.
For example, the table:
 ```
+---------+------------+
| student | class      |
+---------+------------+
| A       | Math       |
| B       | English    |
| C       | Math       |
| D       | Biology    |
| E       | Math       |
| F       | Computer   |
| G       | Math       |
| H       | Math       |
| I       | Math       |
+---------+------------+
 ```
Should output:
 ```
+---------+
| class   |
+---------+
| Math    |
+---------+
 ```

## Idea
Firstly, Select all the distinct data points of table `courses`.

Secondly, Using GROUP BY and HAVING to figure out which class has more than or equal to 5 persons.

## Solution
 ```sql
SELECT class
FROM (SELECT Distinct student, class
      FROM courses) AS table1
GROUP BY class
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 5;
 ```
