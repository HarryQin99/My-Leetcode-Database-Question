## Transaction(事务）
### Definition
Transaction is a logical unit of work that must either be entirely completed or aborted.
事务指的是满足 ACID 特性的一组操作，可以通过 Commit 提交一个事务，也可以使用 Rollback 进行回滚。
### Transaction Properties(ACID)
+ Atomicity(原子性): A transaction is treated as a single, indivisible, logical unit of work. All operations in a transaction must be completed; if not them the transaction si aborted.

+ Consistency(一致性): Constraints that hold before a transaction must also hold after it, multiple users accessing the same data see the same value.

+ Isolation(隔离性): Changes made during execution of a transaction connot be seen by other transactions unitil this one is completed.

+ Durability(持久性): When a transaction is complete, the changes made to the database are permanent, even if the system fails.

### Problem caused by Concurrent access(并发事务带来的问题)
+ The Lost Update problem(**丢失修改**): 一个事务的更新覆盖了另一个事务的更新
举例理解: 两个人P1 和 P2 同时想取钱, 原余额为1000。 P1取了800, 剩下200。P2想取100, 剩下900。P1提出修改并且生效以后P2也进行修改操作。这时候P1的修改就被丢失了。
+ The Uncommitted Data problem/Dirty read(**脏读**): 一个事务读取了另一个事务未提交的数据。
Uncommitted data occurs when two transactions execute concurrently and the first is rolled back after the second has already assessed the uncommitted data

The Inconsistent Retrieval problem:

Occurs when one transaction calculates some aggregate functions over a set of data, while other transactions are updating the data.
+ **不可重复读**: 一个事务两次读取同一个数据，两次读取的数据不一致。
+ **幻读**: 一个事务两次读取一个范围的记录，两次读取的记录数不一致。

### Concurrency control methods
1. Lock
+ Guarantees exclusive use of a data item to a current transaction
+ Required to prevent another transaction from reading inconsistent data
2. Timestamp
+ 对于每个transaction, 给予一个独一的timestamp. 当某一transaction想要读或者写的时候, DBMS会比较这个transaction的timestamps与最后一次写这个数据的transaction的timestamp来判断这个transaction是否可以access.
3. Optimistic
+ Based on the assumption that the majority of database operations do not conflict.

#### Lock Granularity
+ Page-level lock(Not commonly used now)
+ Row-level lock
  + Improves data availability but with high overhead
  + Currently the most popular approach
+ Field-level lock
  + Most flexible lock but requires an extremely high level of overhead
  + Not commonly used

#### Types of Locks
+ Binary Locks
  + has onlu two states: *locked* and *unlocked*
  + eliminates "Lost Update" problem(The lock is not released until the statement is completed)
+ The locks allowed both Shared and Exclusive Lockes

#### Shared and Exclusive Locks
+ Exclusive lock(写锁)
  + must be used when transaction intends to WRITE
  + granted if and only if no other locks are held on the data item
  要求：加锁时没有认识其他锁在当中
+ Shared lock(读锁)
  + other transactions are also granted Read access
  + issued when a transaction wants to READ data, no Exclusive lock is hold on the data item
可以存在多个读锁，但是一旦有一个写锁就无法再加任何锁

#### Deadlock
Candition that occurs when two transactions wait for each other to unlock data
+ Each waits to get a data item which the other transaction is already holding
+ Could wait forever if not dealt with
+ Only happends with exclusive locks
