# 181. Employees Earning More Than Their Managers
## Describtion
The Employee table holds all employees including their managers. Every employee has an Id, and there is also a column for the manager Id.
 ```
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
| Id | Name  | Salary | ManagerId |
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
| 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 3         |
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 4         |
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | NULL      |
| 4  | Max   | 90000  | NULL      |
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
 ```
Given the Employee table, write a SQL query that finds out employees who earn more than their managers. For the above table, Joe is the only employee who earns more than his manager.
 ```
+----------+
| Employee |
+----------+
| Joe      |
+----------+
 ```
## Idea
Using Inner Join to combine the data of each employee and his(her) manager. 

And then compare the salary value, use WHERE to find the Employee whose salary is higher than his(her) manager.

## Solution
 ```sql
 SELECT E.Name AS Employee
 FROM Employee E INNER JOIN Employee M ON E.ManagerID = M.Id
 WHERE M.Salary < E.Salary;
 ```
